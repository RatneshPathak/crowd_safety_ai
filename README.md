🔬 What We Built
Crowd Safety AI processes live video streams to detect crowd density anomalies, abnormal motion patterns, and classify risk levels in real-time:

text
LOW (0.0-0.3) → Normal crowd movement
MEDIUM (0.3-0.7) → Elevated density/speed  
HIGH (0.7-1.0) → ⚠️ Emergency risk detected
Live Demo Output: Risk: LOW | Score: 0.24 overlay on video feed 
​

🛠️ Tech Stack

🚀 60-Second Setup
bash
# Clone project
git clone <your-repo>
cd crowd_safety_ai

# Install
pip install -r requirements.txt

# LIVE WEBCAM DEMO (no video file needed!)
python src/main.py
Output: Live risk analysis with Risk: LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH overlays 🎥

📊 Pipeline Architecture
text
📹 Live Webcam/Video → Preprocessing → Density Grid (8x12) 
  ↓
💨 Motion Analysis → Anomaly Detection → Risk Score (0.0-1.0)
  ↓
🖥️ Visual Overlays → "Risk: LOW | Score: 0.24"
Modular Design: 8 independent, testable modules ✅

⚙️ Configuration (config.py)
python
# Risk Thresholds - TUNE FOR YOUR ENVIRONMENT
DENSITY_LOW, DENSITY_HIGH = 0.3, 0.7
MOTION_HIGH = 5.0  # pixels/frame
ANOMALY_THRESHOLD = 0.8

# Video Settings
FRAME_SKIP = 3
TARGET_SIZE = (640, 480)
🎖️ Hackathon Advantages
✅ Live Processing - No pre-recorded videos

✅ Privacy Safe - Density-based (no faces detected)

✅ Judge Friendly - Clear Risk: LOW | Score: X.XX overlays

✅ Modular - Easy to explain each component

✅ Scalable - Works on any camera feed

✅ Production Ready - Proper error handling
